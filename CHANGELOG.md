## [0.3.15] - 2026-03-04
> Header & Footer Management, Multi-Column Stability, and Font Fixes

### Features

- **PDF Header/Footer Management API** (#207) — Added a dedicated API for managing page artifacts across Rust, Python, and WASM.
    - **Add:** Ability to insert custom headers and footers with styling and placeholders via `PageTemplate`.
    - **Remove:** Heuristic detection engine to automatically identify and strip repeating artifacts. Includes modular methods: `remove_headers()`, `remove_footers()`, and `remove_artifacts()`. Prioritizes ISO 32000 spec-compliant `/Artifact` tags when available.
    - **Edit:** Ability to mask or replace existing content on a per-page basis via `edit_header()`, `edit_footer()`, and `edit_artifacts()`.
- **Page Templates** — Introduced `PageTemplate`, `HeaderFooter`, and `HFStyle` classes for reusable page design. Supports dynamic placeholders like `{page}`, `{pages}`, `{title}`, and `{author}`.
- **Scoped Extraction Filtering** — Updated all extraction methods to respect `erase_regions`, enabling clean text extraction by excluding identified headers and footers.
- **Python `PdfDocument.from_bytes()`** — Open PDFs directly from in-memory bytes without requiring a file path. (Contributed by **@hoesler** in #216)
- **Future-Proofed Rust API** — Implemented `Default` trait for key extraction structs (`TextSpan`, `TextChar`, `TextContent`) to protect users from future field additions.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Multi-Column Reading Order** (#211) — Refactored `extract_words()` and `extract_text_lines()` to use XY-Cut partitioning. This prevents text from adjacent columns from being interleaved and standardizes top-to-bottom extraction. (Reported by **@ankursri494**)
- **Resolved Font Identity Collisions** (#213) — Improved font identity hashing to include `ToUnicode` and `DescendantFonts` references. Fixes garbled text extraction in documents where multiple fonts share the same name but use different character mappings. (Reported by **@productdevbook**)
- **Fixed `Lines` table strategy false positives** (#215) — `extract_tables()` with `horizontal_strategy="lines"` now builds the grid purely from vector path geometry and returns empty when no lines are found, preventing spurious tables on plain-text pages. (Contributed by **@hoesler**)
- **Fixed Encrypted `CIDToGIDMap` Handling** (#202) — Ensured `CIDToGIDMap` streams are correctly decrypted in encrypted PDFs, fixing empty text extraction for certain OpenPDF-generated files. (Contributed by **@vincenzopalazzo** in #203)
- **Optimized CMap Parsing** — Standardized 2-byte consumption for Identity-H fonts and improved robust decoding for Turkish and other extended character sets.
